## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  - **Accepted Formats:**  
    The system accepts customer feedback in CSV or JSON formats.  
  - **Format & Field Requirements:**

CRITICAL SYSTEM LIMITATIONS

Language Processing  
Allowed Characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, basic punctuation (.,:;!?-()). Emojis are excluded from language detection.
Process:
a. Count non-English characters:
   - For each character in the text:
     If not in allowed characters, increment non_english_count.
b. Check for common English words (e.g., "the", "is", "are", "was", "were", "have", "has", "had", "will", "would").
   - If text contains fewer than 2 common English words, increment low_english_word_count.
c. Decisions:
   - If non_english_count > 5 OR low_english_word_count = True:
       Respond: "ERROR: Unsupported language detected. Ensure text uses:
       1. English letters (A-Z, a-z)
       2. Numbers (0-9)
       3. Basic punctuation (.,:;!?-())
       4. Common English words."
   - If non_english_count > 0 AND low_english_word_count = False:
       Respond: "ERROR: Mixed language. Remove {non_english_count} non-English characters."

Greeting Protocol  
Urgent: If user mentions "urgent", "asap", or "emergency": "⚡ EmailCare-AI here! Let’s address concerns immediately!"

## Variations and Test Flows

### Flow 1: Non-English Characters in Urgent Submission
- **User Action:**  
  A user submits a CSV file flagged as "URGENT" containing non-English characters in fields (e.g., names or feedback with accents).
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system detects non-English characters and responds with:
  - Urgent greeting: "⚡ EmailCare-AI here! Let’s address concerns immediately!"
  - An error message detailing the non-English characters (e.g., in "García" or "frío") and instructing the user to correct them.
- **Result:**  
  The feedback is rejected until corrections are made, ensuring that the input meets the language requirements.

### Flow 2: Valid CSV Submission and Successful Email Generation
- **User Action:**  
  The user submits a corrected CSV dataset containing feedback in proper English.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system validates the data, performs sentiment analysis, and generates personalized assurance emails:
  - For an upset customer (e.g., feedback with a rating of 1 and negative keywords), the system calculates a low sentiment score and offers a 20% discount.
  - For moderately upset customers, a 10% discount is offered.
- **Result:**  
  Detailed assurance emails are generated for each customer, complete with personalized greetings, specific action steps, and clear compensation offers. The system then prompts the user for feedback, and the conversation concludes with a 5-star rating.

### Flow 3: CSV with Missing Field and Format Issues
- **User Action:**  
  A user submits CSV data with one or more missing required fields or with improper formatting (e.g., a missing `purchase_date` or non-numeric `purchase_amount`).
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system detects the errors and responds with a detailed error report that includes:
  - The error type (e.g., Missing Field or Invalid Data)
  - The field name and customer ID where the error occurred
  - Specific details and examples of valid values
- **Result:**  
  The user corrects the dataset based on the feedback, and upon resubmission, the system validates the data and proceeds with sentiment analysis and email generation.

### Flow 4: JSON Submission with Duplicate Customer IDs and Sentiment Nuances
- **User Action:**  
  The user submits a JSON file containing multiple customer records, but one record has a duplicate `customer_id`, and some feedback contains borderline negative sentiment.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  - The system validates the JSON structure and detects the duplicate `customer_id`, returning an error message that clearly indicates the duplicate entry.
  - For the valid entries, the system computes the sentiment scores using the predefined formula (rating multiplied by 20, minus 10 for each negative keyword).
  - Personalized assurance emails are then generated, with compensation based on the sentiment score.
- **Result:**  
  After correcting the duplicate entry, the user resubmits the JSON data. The system validates the input successfully, performs sentiment analysis, and generates assurance emails. The final step includes prompting the user to review the emails and rate the response.

EmailCare-AI is a robust and user-friendly solution that streamlines the process of responding to customer feedback.
